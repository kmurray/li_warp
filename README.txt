#  Latency Insensitive (LI) Shell Generator & Components

##############################################################################

This release consists of scripts and parameterized System Verilog code used to
generate LI shells, and other LI building block components, which were 
presented in:

    K. E. Murray and V. Betz, "Quantifying the Cost and Benefit of Latency 
        Insensitive Communication on FPGAs", In Proceedings of the 2014 
        ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays
        (FPGA '14), 2014, 223-232.



The release contains the following:

    li_wrap.pl: A script which takes as input a verilog file containing a 
                single module and generates a LI shell. Run with the -h option 
                for more detailed usage information. 
                Requires Perl with the Getopt::Long, and Verilog::Netlist from 
                Verilog-Perl (see http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilog-perl).

    verilog_lib: A collection of parameterized System Verilog modules used in 
                 the resulting LI systems. These include bypass-able FIFOs, a
                 LI interface, and Relay Stations. 

    example: A simple example design consisting of a pearl module, LI shell 
             wrapper generated by li_wrap.pl, a top module and a Quartus II 
             project within which the example design can be compiled.
